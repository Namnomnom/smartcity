# smartcity

In this student project, we aim to develop a system to measure the number of people in large crowds, which is a key aspect of smart city infrastructure. Monitoring crowd density can help improve public safety, event planning, and urban mobility in real time.

To achieve this, we explore different sensor-based and vision-based approaches for crowd measurement. Our system is designed to:

- Detect and estimate the number of people in a specific area
- Work in both indoor and outdoor environments
- Operate with low latency and high accuracy
- Collect and transmit data for further analysis and visualization
